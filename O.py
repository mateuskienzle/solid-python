''' Here, in this program, i applied the Openâ€“closed principle from SOLID. 
    I'm applying this principle from the previous program, the one what i applied the Single-responsibility principle.
    So, what i did: i separeted the both forms of payment into two classes now. And also modified the "PaymentProcessor" class,
    giving to this class a generic value, that i can set to the other classes in my program.
    So i can use this classe to pass itself as a parameter to the other two classes of payments types (debit and credit).
    And, to do that, i had to import ABC method from abc library, so i could set the "PaymentProcessor" class as a generic class
    
    In this way, now i can create any extension for my application, without modifying any of others classes and functions that already exist.
    For example, now i can create another form of payment, without change anything in the classes or functions from the others payments types'''

        return total
