''' Here, in this program, i applied the Liskov substitution principle from SOLID. 
    I'm applying this principle from the previous program, the one what i applied the Openâ€“closed principle.
    So, what i did: i removed the "security_code" parameter from the "PaymentProcessor" class, and instead of this parameter
    being passed in the "PaymentProcessor" class, we are passing the parameter into each every function. 
    So, in this way, we can set any type of paramenter, and not necessary a security code as parameter. For exemple, if we include 
    a paypal payment type, it doesn't use security code, but use email adress as a form of verification. And, without put the parameter
    about security into each every class, wouldn't make sense pass an email adress in a parameter called "security_code". 
    And also, to this be possible, is necessary to create an initializer function in each class that would receive the parameter.'''
